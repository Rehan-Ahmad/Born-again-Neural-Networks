# Born-again-Neural-Networks
 * This repository includes the training and inference of Born-again Neural Networks for x-rays classification. 
 * The main implementation is taken from: https://github.com/nocotan/born_again_neuralnet and converted into single notebook.
 * MobileNetv2 model is added in the code and training is done for x-rays data taken from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.
 * Teacher model "MobileNetv2" which is trained on x-rays data is also provided in this repository.
